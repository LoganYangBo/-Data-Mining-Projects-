Projection1:
This homework will focus on a modified version of the kaggle dataset "Pima Indians Diabets Database". It can be found here. The overarching objective is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based upon several other covariates. The full description is shown on the website.

Your task will be to first: 1) Do the prerequisite EDA to understand the data set you will be working on.

2) Fit an appropriate logistic model and analyze it.

While some of the questions have exact answers, a few others are more open to interpretation. However, what we're looking for is the correct thinking and analysis. For the objective questions, while some points are awarded for "the correct number", the majority of the points will be awarded for a proper analysis and logical investigation.

Note: The data has been modified in both some subtle and not-so-subtle ways. You're welcome to look at other previous work online (in kaggle, stack overflow, etc -- and in fact that's critical to learning how to write good code!) but be wary about just using other people's work. It would both be a violation of the academic code of conduct, but it may also lead you down the wrong path.
